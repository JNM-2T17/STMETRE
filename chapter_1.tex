\chapter{Research Description}
\label{sec:researchdesc}    %--note: labels help you with hyperlink editing (using your IDE)

Make sure to write a preamble for each chapter, i.e., a short description of what each chapter contains before 
the first section within the chapter.  The preamble can be written in about two to three sentences.

\section{Overview of the Current State of Technology}
\label{sec:overview}

Different people may have differing perspectives regarding particular topics. These sentiments
are frequently expressed through social media. Our research is about 
clustering people based on their sentiments regarding specific topics using their social media posts.
An interactive visualization of these communities will then be generated.

This section gives the reader an overview of the specific technology or field in the international or
local setting. The information regarding the technology or field should be contemporary and not
based on outdated sources. Discussion must not be too technical or too detailed.
   
\textcolor{red}{This section ends with a discussion on the problem/s faced by or that still exist in the specific
technology or field (e.g., limitations of existing software or algorithms). The problem statement
would lead to the research objectives.}


It is   easy to include a figure in JPG or PNG format as shown in the 
following example.  Make sure that you explain what the figure is all about,
and that you refer to your figure.  For example, \figref{fig:disneystock} shows a graph of the performance of Disney stock from the 1980s to 2012.
  
%--- the following example shows how to include a figure in PNG format
\begin{figure}[t]                %-- use [t] to place figure at top, [b] to place at the bottom, [h] for here
   \centering                    %-- use this to center the figure
   \includegraphics{DisneyChart.png}      %-- include image file named as "disneychart.png" 
   \caption{This is the figure's caption -- Disney stock chart}
    \label{fig:disneystock}
\end{figure}


Some notes on citing references.   When using APA format, the author-date method of citation is 
followed.   This means that the author's last name and the year of publication for the source should 
appear in the text, and a complete reference should appear in the reference list.

%
% Examples:
%     	Smith (1970) compared reaction times . . .
%     	In a recent study of reaction times (Smith, 1970), . . .   
%     	In 1970, Smith compared reaction times . . .
%	Smith, et al., (1970) compared reaction times . . .
%     	In a recent study of reaction times (Smith, et al., 1970), . . .  
%     	In 1970, Smith, et al., compared reaction times . . .
%

Here are some examples on how to do the referencing (note author's name and years are different
from commented examples).  For APA citation details, refer
to \url{http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/biblio/bibtex/contrib/apacite/}. 

\begin{itemize}
 \item \citeA{kartch:2000:ERA} compared reaction times...
 \item In a recent study of reaction times \cite{kartch:2000:ERA}...
 \item In \citeyearNP{kartch:2000:ERA}, \citeauthor{kartch:2000:ERA} compared reaction times...
 \item \shortciteA{fedkiw:2001:VSO} compared reaction times... 
 \item In a recent study of reaction times \cite{fedkiw:2001:VSO}...
 \item In \citeyearNP{fedkiw:2001:VSO}, \shortciteauthor{fedkiw:2001:VSO}, compared reaction times...
\end{itemize}

The following are references from journal articles \cite{Park:2006:DSI, Pellacini:2005:LAH, 
sako:2001:SSB}.  Here's an MS thesis document \cite{yee:2000:SSA}, and this is from
PhD dissertation \cite{kartch:2000:ERA}. For a book, reference is given as 
\cite{parke:1996:CFA}.  Proceedings from a conference samples are \cite{Jobs95, fedkiw:2001:VSO,
levoy:2000:TDM}.  The sample bibliography file named \textbf{myreferences.bib} is from the
SIGGRAPH \LaTeX template.  You can use a text editor to view the contents of the bib file.  
It is your task to create your own bibliography file.  For those who downloaded papers from
ACM or IEEE sites, there is a BibTeX link that you can click; thereafter, you just simply need
to copy and paste the BibTeX entry into your own bibliography file.



The following shows how to include a program source code (or algorithm).  The verbatim environment,
as the name suggests, outputs text (including white spaces) as is...

\begin{verbatim}
               #include <stdio.h>
               main()
               {
                    printf("Hello world!\n");
               }
\end{verbatim}


\textcolor{red}{DO NOT FORGET to write the statement of the research problem here, i.e.,
before the Research Objectives.}



\section{Research Objectives}
\label{sec:researchobjectives}

\subsection{General Objective}
\label{sec:generalobjective}

This research's end goal is to produce a visualization of the detected communities.


\subsection{Specific Objectives}
\label{sec:specificobjectives}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item To know the various techniques and algorithms in detecting communities;
	\item To identify the appropriate parameters to use in detecting the communities;
	\item To determine how to evaluate the correctness of the detected communities
\end{enumerate}

\section{Scope and Limitations of the Research}
\label{sec:scopelimitations}

This section discusses the boundaries (with respect to the objectives) of the research and the constraints within 
which the research will be developed.

\begin{comment}

%
Generally, one paragraph should be allotted for each of your research objectives.

Each paragraph contains a brief overview of the concept/theory and the purpose of doing the associated objective.

Each paragraph also includes a description of the scope/limitation of your study.

* Please refer to the slides for examples.

\section{Significance of the Research}
\label{sec:significance}

This section explains why research must be done in this area.  It rationalizes the objective of the research with that of the stated problem. 
Avoid including sentences such as ``This research will be beneficial to the proponent/department/college'' as this is already an inherent
requirement of all BS and MS thesis projects.  Focus on the research's contribution to the Computer Science field.

The following are guide questions that may help your formulate the significance of your research.
